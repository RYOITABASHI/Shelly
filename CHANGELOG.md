# Changelog

All notable changes to Shelly are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Dates are in
`YYYY-MM-DD`. Shelly uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Interactive Scouter widget** — the home-screen widget is no longer
  read-only: tap **ASK** to inject a prompt into the bound Codex PTY, and
  answer Codex with **Allow / Deny** and numbered **1 / 2 / 3** choice pills
  that write straight to the terminal, with a stale-tap guard that re-parses the
  live screen before firing.
- **Live rate-limit + chronometer** — the widget surfaces a `RATE LIMITED`
  override the moment a usage limit hits, plus a self-ticking chronometer that
  counts down to the rate-limit reset (or up the running session) without a
  widget re-render.
- **Quota gauge** — a 5-cell remaining-quota bar (`5H` / `WK`) using filled/empty
  squares, green while healthy and glowing red once it drops to its last cell.
- **Derived Codex cost** — the USAGE line shows `$cost` derived from a bundled
  LiteLLM price table, since Codex emits no cost itself.
- **Per-category Codex notification channels** — approvals, choices, and errors
  arrive as heads-up alerts on their own Android channels (tunable from system
  settings), with one-tap **Allow / Deny** and **1 / 2 / 3** action buttons and
  the full request / menu text in the expanded view.
- **Two-line conversation + relative idle time** — the widget shows the last
  `YOU` prompt and `CODEX` reply, and the idle line reads `idle · 3m ago`.

### Changed

- **Release version bumped to 6.0.0** across Expo config, Android versionName,
  and runtimeVersion (versionCode stays git-derived).
- **Widget readability** — larger status / usage fonts, the lower row header
  renamed `MODEL` → `LOCAL` to stop colliding with the Codex `MODEL` token, and
  the token total labelled `TOK … used` to disambiguate it from rate `… left`.
- **Idle freshness** — a ~60s poll heartbeat keeps CPU / RAM / clock / footer
  current while idle, and the footer `updated` time now reflects the actual
  render, not the last event.
- **README** documents the interactive widget, the Agent Chat surface for the
  bound Codex, and the notification channels.

### Fixed

- **Updates modal overflow hotfix (v6.0.0 build 1505)** — fixed horizontal
  right-clipping on Fold layouts by opening Updates as a top-level modal and
  tightening shrink/wrap constraints for long update labels, toolbar buttons,
  and release action rows.
- **Updates screen could hang forever on "Checking…"** — the GitHub fetch body
  read was unbounded after the response headers arrived; the whole refresh is
  now bounded by a timeout so it always completes.
- **LOCAL offline row contradiction** — the health line said "no endpoint" while
  the metrics line still showed `END :11434`; offline now reads `Offline` +
  `LOCAL PROBE <ports>`.
- **Duplicated status signal** — the `[OK]` / `[--]` indicator no longer appears
  on both the status line and the top-right badge.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- **Release version bumped to 5.3.1** across Expo config, package metadata,
  Android versionName/versionCode, and runtimeVersion.
- **Local LLM catalog refreshed** — Qwen 3 8B Q4_K_M is now the recommended
  high-quality model for high-end Android/foldable devices, while Qwen 2.5
  1.5B remains the low-memory fallback.
- **README and release-surface docs synced** with the supported CLI posture:
  Claude Code and Codex are the supported foreground CLIs, Gemini CLI remains
  Experimental, and AI Pane/background automation uses explicit API providers.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Supported Codex CLI login path** — bare `codex` now routes through
  Shelly's device-code wrapper when `~/.codex/auth.json` is missing or
  invalid, opens the in-app Browser Pane, writes credentials with private
  file modes, then launches the normal Codex TUI. Device validation shows
  `codex-exec 0.130.0` and GPT-5.5.
- **Release-surface documentation** — README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and
  GEMINI.md now explicitly distinguish supported foreground CLIs,
  API-backed AI pane/background providers, and Experimental Gemini CLI.

### Changed

- **Release version bumped to 5.3.0** across Expo config, package metadata,
  Android versionName/versionCode, and runtimeVersion.
- **Claude Code subscription boundary tightened** — Claude Code remains a
  foreground user-controlled terminal CLI. AI Pane and background agents use
  explicit API providers such as Gemini API, Cerebras, Groq, Perplexity, and
  OpenAI-compatible local routes.
- **Sidebar Worktrees and Quick Launch narrowed to Claude Code and Codex**.
  Gemini CLI is hidden from release shortcuts while investigation continues.
- **New terminal tabs autofocus their terminal** so split-pane session
  creation lands keyboard input in the newly opened shell.

### Fixed

- **Codex auth loop from the normal startup prompt** — the wrapper now
  launches Shelly's device-code login path before the upstream Codex TUI
  starts, avoiding the unsupported `/login` REPL route on Android.

### Known limitations

- **Gemini CLI remains Experimental**. `gemini --version` works through the
  APK bundle tier, but Gemini CLI 0.42.x has shown blank TUI startup, slow
  rendering, and shell-tool signal 11 behavior on Android/musl. Gemini API
  remains supported for AI Pane/background use.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Latest Claude Code 2.1.131 runs as the default tier** — the runtime
  updater promotes the latest `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-linux-arm64-musl`
  release and the LD_PRELOAD wrappers carry the trampoline. Bash tool
  works end to end inside Claude Code at 2.1.131.
- **Sidebar Quick Launch section** between TASKS and REPOSITORIES.
  Three compact chips (Claude orange / Codex green / Gemini blue) open
  a fresh Terminal pane and run the matching CLI in one tap.
- **Bun.hash polyfill** with full named-variant coverage (wyhash,
  cityHash32/64, xxHash3/32/64, murmur32v2/v3, murmur64v1/v2, rapidhash,
  adler32, crc32). SHA-256-backed; honours the `seed` argument so
  `Bun.hash(K, Bun.hash(q))` retains its seed-distinct invariant.
- **Runtime-failure feedback loop** — native-tier crash signals append
  to `~/.shelly-runtime/.runtime-failures`; the next
  `__shelly_bg_cli_update` consumes the file and adds those versions
  to `recordFailedVersion`'s cooldown so the updater walks past them.
- **`SHELLY_LEGACY_NPM_PIN`** environment variable — defaults to
  `2.1.112` (last npm release with `cli.js`); override to test a
  different tag.
- **`SHELLY_PREFER_NATIVE_CLAUDE`** environment variable — historically
  required to opt in to the native Bun SEA tier. No longer needed for
  default usage now that the SEA path is stable; kept for explicit
  control.
- **`BUN_TMPDIR=$HOME/.bun-tmp`** is set in the bashrc so Bun's lazy
  `.node` extraction has a known writable directory and a single-shot
  retry can clean it on crash.

### Changed

- **`exec-wrapper.c` and `exec-wrapper-musl.c` rewritten to use raw
  arm64 `svc #0` syscalls** — `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, ...)`, libdl, liblog,
  malloc, and TLS were all removed from the LD_PRELOAD shim's
  interception path. The bug class "wrapper crashes during fresh CI
  rebuild" is gone.
- **Two embedded Bun SEA `.node` add-ons are byte-patched out** —
  `audio-capture.node` and `image-processor.node` loader call sites
  return `null` instead of invoking `process.dlopen()`. Same-length
  patch keeps offsets stable. Voice native input and the image
  processor native helper are disabled; JS fallbacks handle the
  "feature missing" case. Patch is applied both at runtime promotion
  time (`shelly-runtime-update.js`) and at CI build time (the bundled
  `libclaude.so`).
- **`__shelly_bg_cli_update` pinned to
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.112`** by default. 2.1.113+ removed
  `cli.js` from the npm tarball, so chasing `@latest` on a Node-only
  path is structurally impossible.
- **`LibExtractor.kt::ALWAYS_REFRESH` extended** to include
  `libexec_wrapper.so` and `claude` (the bundled byte-patched
  `libclaude.so`). Wrapper rewrites and SEA byte patches now reach
  existing devices on app upgrade without a `versionCode` bump.
- **`BASHRC_VERSION` 73 → 76**.
- **Quick Launch chip styling** — compact one-row layout, Anthropic
  copper/orange (`#CC785C`) for Claude.

### Fixed

- **Wrapper SIGSEGV on fresh CI rebuild** (`pc=0x1ff0` PLT
  trampoline). Root cause was the bionic linker not resolving the
  wrapper's `dlsym` PLT entry; raw-syscall rewrite eliminates the
  dependency entirely.
- **Bun SEA segfault while loading `audio-capture.node` /
  `image-processor.node`** (Anthropic Claude Code issue
  [#54530](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/54530)).
  Bypassed at the SEA level via byte patch.
- **`grep` SEGV in any pipeline** — `static __thread char rewrite_buf[]`
  in the LD_PRELOAD wrapper pulled in Clang's emulated-TLS helper,
  whose own PLT entries were unresolved. Buffer is now stack-allocated
  and threaded through `rewrite_path()` as a parameter; `errno = ...`
  writes (also TLS-backed) were also removed.
- **`Bun.hash is not a function`** at Claude Code 2.1.112 startup
  through the legacy npm tier — covered by the new polyfill.

### Known limitations

- Claude Code's voice native input and image processor native paths
  are disabled. Re-enable automatically once Bun upstream fixes the
  Android arm64 musl `.node` segfault.
- `~/.shelly-cli` legacy install uses `--omit=optional`, so versions
  past 2.1.112 won't populate `cli.js` from Anthropic's restructured
  npm package. Pin defaults make this a no-op for users today.
- `ALWAYS_REFRESH += "claude"` copies ~220 MB out of the APK on every
  app launch. Future work: sha / build-marker diff refresh.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Build 782 security harness** — documented the release-gate checks for
  `shelly-doctor` credential hygiene, CLI runtime smoke tests, and GitHub
  secret-scanning false-positive handling in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-build-782-security-harness.md`.
- **Log secret redaction** — app debug logging now redacts common API key and
  token patterns before writing to logcat. Unit tests cover OpenAI, Google,
  Groq, Cerebras, and environment-style secret strings without keeping literal
  secret-shaped fixtures in the repository.
- **`shelly-doctor` security checks** — doctor now reports leftover credential
  handoff files in `/sdcard/Download`, private-mode status for credential files,
  and whether known API-key environment variables are present.

- **Ask Pane** — Shelly's self-documenting assistant (Stage 1). New
  pane type `ask` opens via the "+" menu or pane switcher. Users ask
  natural-language questions ("can Shelly do X?" / "how do I use Y?")
  and the built-in feature catalog + curated shipping/roadmap snippets
  feed into a Groq-backed answer via the existing streaming dispatch.
  Each response ends with a coloured status badge:

    ✅ **AVAILABLE**       — feature ships today; answer walks through it.
    ⏳ **PLANNED**          — on the DEFERRED backlog; priority surfaced
                             when stated.
    ❌ **NOT_AVAILABLE**    — no evidence in docs; Stage 2 will add a
                             one-tap "Create GitHub issue" button here.

  No new LLM plumbing: reuses `groqChatStream` via `systemPromptOverride`.
  Zero native/Kotlin changes.

- **`shelly-cs open` routes into Shelly's Browser Pane via deep link**.
  A custom `shelly://browser?url=<encoded>` scheme is registered on
  Shelly's `MainActivity` (the `shelly://` family was already in the
  manifest from expo-router scaffolding — we just added a handler in
  `app/_layout.tsx`). The codespace web URL lands inside Shelly's
  in-app WebView instead of kicking out to Chrome. Falls back to the
  raw VIEW intent (external browser) if the deep-link start fails.

- **`cs` shortcut + default codespace**. `cs` is a `.bashrc` alias for
  `shelly-cs`. `shelly-cs use <name>` persists a default codespace to
  `$HOME/.shelly-cs/config.json` (verified via REST before saving).
  `shelly-cs open` with no args resolves in order: positional arg →
  default → the only Available/Shutdown codespace → helpful error.
  `shelly-cs list` marks the default with a yellow ★. `shelly-cs`
  with no command falls through to `open` when authenticated.

  Target UX from any `$PWD`:
  ```
  cs use sturdy-cod-557j97jgggjc7p4w   # one-time
  cs                                    # → codespace in Browser Pane
  ```

- **Clipboard auto-copy during `shelly-cs auth`**. The OAuth device
  code is written to the Android clipboard via a new `shelly://
  clipboard?text=<encoded>` deep link handled by the same
  `app/_layout.tsx` Linking listener. `app/_layout.tsx` calls
  `Clipboard.setStringAsync` (already a project dep). Paste directly
  in the browser instead of retyping the 8-char pair.

- **`shelly-cs` — GitHub Codespaces CLI** (Phase 1 minimum). Pure-Node
  helper that speaks the GitHub REST API directly. No gh CLI dependency,
  no external binaries, bundled bionic `node` runs it unchanged. Ships
  as an APK asset (`modules/.../assets/shelly-cs.js`) extracted to
  `$HOME/.shelly-cs/shelly-cs.js` on every launch.

  Commands: `auth` (OAuth device flow against the Shelly OAuth App),
  `list`, `create [--repo O/R]` (defaults to
  `RYOITABASHI/shelly-codespace-template` which pre-installs
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`), `open`, `stop`, `delete --yes`,
  `doctor`, `logout`. `ssh` is stubbed for Phase 1.5 — `open` gives
  you the codespace's web terminal for now.

  Env-overridable constants: `SHELLY_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`,
  `SHELLY_CS_DEFAULT_REPO`, `SHELLY_CS_SCOPE`, `SHELLY_CS_DEBUG`.

- **Three-tier fallback for `claude`**: `$HOME/.shelly-cli` (auto-updated)
  → `$HOME/.shelly-cli.prev` (last-known-good snapshot) →
  `$libDir/node_modules` (APK-bundled golden). `claude()` walks the
  tiers at invocation time, reporting which tier it landed on (unless
  `SHELLY_SILENT_CLI_TIER=1`). The `__shelly_bg_cli_update` background
  job now stages into `$HOME/.shelly-cli.staging`, runs a 15-second
  `node cli.js --version` health check, and rotates only on success —
  a broken `@latest` never reaches the live tree and never blocks the
  `claude` command.

- Four additional theme presets: **Dracula**, **Nord**, **Gruvbox**,
  **Tokyo Night**. Selectable from Settings → Display → Theme or the
  Command Palette (`theme-dracula`, `theme-nord`, `theme-gruvbox`,
  `theme-tokyo-night`). Runtime swap, no PTY restart.
- **MCP Servers** management UI wired into Settings → Integrations.
  Opens the existing `McpSection` (catalog, add/remove, run command)
  as a slide-up Modal backed by the JNI `execCommand` bridge.
- **Local LLM · llama.cpp** management UI wired into Settings →
  Integrations. Opens the existing `LlamaCppSection` (model catalog
  with RAM hints, guided setup, download, start/stop, delete) as a
  slide-up Modal with a 10-minute command timeout so builds and
  downloads don't get killed.
- **Scheduled agents** in the Sidebar Tasks section: lists every
  registered `@agent` with run-now (▶) and delete (🗑) actions backed
  by `agent-executor.generateRunNowCommand()` and
  `agent-manager.deleteAgent()`.
- `SECURITY.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. README now carries a GitHub
  Actions build badge.

### Changed

- **`claude` dispatch simplified** to `_run node cli.js` (v26 pattern
  restored). The v28–v30 detour (Bun binary + proot + Alpine chroot +
  musl sub-package + CA bundle + `/etc/*` population) turned out to be
  over-engineering — the npm tarball for
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@<=2.1.112` ships a plain-JS `cli.js` that
  runs under Shelly's bundled bionic node unmodified. Five-agent survey
  (GitHub issues, Ishabdullah/claude-code-termux, Qiita/Zenn/LINUX DO)
  converged on the same dispatch.
- **`claude-code` pinned to 2.1.112** — the final release that ships
  `cli.js` as a pure-JS entry point. Both the CI bundle step and
  `__shelly_bg_cli_update` pin explicitly. 2.1.113 replaced `cli.js`
  with a Bun-compiled SEA binary (`bin/claude.exe`) whose only entry
  point `cli-wrapper.cjs` is a platform-detect + spawn launcher with no
  JS fallback. Latest claude-code on mobile now requires Codespaces —
  see `shelly-cs` above.
- **Paste pipeline (bug #97 root fix)** — multi-line paste now arrives
  at bash as a single bracketed-paste chunk again. Earlier dispatch
  failed on bionic bash's readline because the ESC in `\e[200~` was
  swallowed by the meta-prefix handler; we now trigger
  `bracketed-paste-begin` via an ESC-free `\C-x\C-b` keybind instead,
  which `.bashrc` binds in the emacs, vi-insert, and vi-command
  keymaps. `TerminalEmulator.paste()` gates the wrap on DECSET 2004 so
  vim / less / nano still get the pre-#91 `\r?\n → \r` fallback.
- **README** — Coming Soon trimmed to genuine unknowns only (app icon
  + store distribution, end-to-end device smoke tests). Status table
  rewritten to reflect shipping state of theme presets, MCP,
  llama.cpp, SSH profiles, scheduled agents, and Ports monitor.
- **Sidebar Profiles** is now documented as shipping (it had been a
  section shell in the README but was in fact a fully-wired orphan
  the whole time — ~/.ssh/config import, long-press edit/delete,
  tap-to-insert `ssh -i KEY user@host -p PORT`, key-file auth only).

### Removed

- **Sidebar CLOUD section** — the Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive
  placeholder rows, the OAuth URL table, and `handleCloudConnect`.
  Shelly defers cloud storage to [`rclone`](https://rclone.org), which
  already speaks 40+ backends from the terminal pane. README Feature
  Tour now points at rclone directly. Status table flips the Cloud
  row from 🟡 to 🚫 out-of-scope.

### Known issues

These are tracked for the first tagged release but not yet fixed:

- **Enter key sometimes needs two presses** in freshly-spawned PTY
  sessions. Suspected to be the `TerminalSession` Kotlin
  non-blocking read loop racing with the initial prompt render —
  native debug next.
- **Voice dialogue, immortal sessions, and AlarmManager scheduling**
  are wired end-to-end but have not been smoke-tested on-device since
  the Plan B (Termux-free) migration.
- **App icon + Play Store / F-Droid distribution** — the APK ships
  via GitHub Releases only. Icon brief exists, store flow does not.

---

Earlier history (pre-changelog) is visible in `git log`. Noteworthy
milestones:

- **Shelly theme preset + runtime swap + Silkscreen single-weight
  monkey-patch** — `4687da97` through `ca428062`
- **Plan B (Termux-free JNI forkpty + APK-bundled binaries)**
  completes — commit `1323a287`
- **Superset UI redesign** — 50+ commits, mock-faithful pane/sidebar
  layout with Silkscreen pixel font
- **AI Edit golden path** — stage → unified diff → per-hunk accept →
  disk writeback with fuzzy re-anchor
